Thousands of apps are released daily to solve problems big and small. My dream is to be part of that community striving to create a better world. Software development is my way of doing so.

It wasn’t until I, like many others, was furloughed during the pandemic that I realized just how important the software we use daily really is. Apps that deliver our groceries and communicate with our friends have become powerful tools in protecting ourselves and our loved ones. Communication between coworkers and friends moved remotely. The need for digital solutions to both old and new problems drove me to a new education.

Over the course of 10 months, [The Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) challenged me to grow my skills and left me excited to start a career in software development. I am now a motivated Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for problem solving. I enjoy a challenge and welcome any opportunity to learn.
